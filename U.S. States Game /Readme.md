Have used the basic knowledge of pandas to build this small educational naming game, here we test our knowledge of the number of US states we know correctly.

extra feature:
we get to know what all states we have missed to that we can learn from the list. this is saved in a seperate csv file, triggered when we enter "Exit" in the answer input box

Download the below image to use while running the program.
