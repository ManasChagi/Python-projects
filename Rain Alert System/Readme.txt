Here in this project, I've created a Rain ALert system using API's 
so basically what the project does is, it checks the 12 hours prior  weather data of the location you'd provide in the form of latitude and longitude in the project, 
and if there are traces of rain, we get an SMS on the phone number specified in the code,
Sending sms is possible through a website called "Twilio", whose module we import in our code and its accordingly accustomed.

website for weather tracking is : Open Weather Map
SMS related services are through - Twilio.
