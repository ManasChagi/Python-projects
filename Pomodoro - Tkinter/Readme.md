Hello, So this is a simple and Effective Pomodoro tkinter project made;
download the tomoto pic for the background from tomato.md file in the repo
Just remember that whichever pic you download for the background of this pomodoro page, attach its path link in the code where "tomato.png" is mentioned as a path in my code.
if you attach the path link properly then you wont have troubles getting the proper output. 

NOTE:
i've set up my screen based on the tomato pic i'd selected so the buttons and labels are placed according to the pic, if you want to to change the pic then you'll have to 
set you own positions accordingly for the pic you've selected!
