Hello, This is a project of Quizes, created by using OOPS concept(classes, objects, inheritance etc)
-> created GUI using Python - Tkinter
-> Each time the program runs, New set of questions are displayed to which the right and wrong answers are considered accordingly.
-> For this, I've also taken the help of API to connect and get questions from  Open Trivia  Database

This project can be very much optimised further, like we can add a Refresh button such that we can start the game again without having to re-run the program. Then maybe there can be a score tracker set up and highscores can be displayed, etc
