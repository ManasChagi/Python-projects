Hello, This is a project of Quizes, created by using OOPS concept(classes, objects, inheritance etc)
-> created GUI using Python - Tkinter
-> Each time the program runs, New set of questions are displayed to which the right and wrong answers are considered accordingly.
-> For this, I've also taken the help of API to connect and get questions from  Open Trivia  Database

One con that i can likely find in this project is that, while we press the "Right" Button to indicate the answer to be right or wrong, if we happen to click the button too fast, it'll have an impact on the score.. the score increases without checking the answer.. This is one bug here which is yet to be solve, else if the question is read and answered properly, there is no error in the project.

This project can be very much optimised further, like we can add a Refresh button such that we can start the game again without having to re-run the program. Then maybe there can be a score tracker set up and highscores can be displayed, etc
